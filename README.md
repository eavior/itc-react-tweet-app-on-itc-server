# About this project

Project of the ITC full stack development course.

Tweet app built with React. This version uses localStorage for the user data, and the ITC server for the tweet data.
Another version, which I am still working on, connects to Firebase and has additional features: https://github.com/eavior/itc-react-tweet-app-firebaseDB
